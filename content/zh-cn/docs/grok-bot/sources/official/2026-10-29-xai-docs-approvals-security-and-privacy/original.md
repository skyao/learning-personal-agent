# Approvals, security, and privacy

Grok Bot is designed to complete work while keeping sensitive inputs and
consequential actions under your control. Use approvals, secure handoffs, and
clear Bot boundaries together.

## Set a boundary in the request

Tell the Bot which actions it can take and where it must stop:

> Reconcile the campaign data and draft a recommended budget change. Do not
> change the campaign or message the agency. Ask for approval after showing the
> current value, proposed value, and expected impact.

Prefer explicit boundaries for:

* Sending messages or invitations
* Publishing content
* Purchases and financial transfers
* Deleting or overwriting data
* Changing permissions
* Production changes
* Accepting legal terms

An approval controls the proposed action. It does not reverse work already
completed.

## Review an action

Auto Review checks each action your Bot is about to take, for example before it
runs a command, uses a connected app, or uses its computer. Most actions run on
their own. When one needs your OK, the Bot shows an approval card in your chat
with the proposed operation and its inputs, and waits for your answer. An action
that matches one of your **Ask first** rules always gets a card. Review the
target, scope, and values before approving.

Auto Review takes into account what you asked for in your own messages. Text
from somewhere else, such as an email or a web page, doesn't count as your
request. Some cards carry a warning, such as **This can't be undone**, **This
changes sign-in or security settings**, or **This shares your data outside this
chat**.

* **Allow once:** the Bot does the action now. No rule is saved.
* **Always allow:** the Bot does the action now and saves an Allow rule to your
  Custom Rules, so similar actions run on their own. The card shows **Saved to
  Custom Rules**.
* **Deny:** the Bot doesn't do it. It won't try that action again or ask you
  about it until you send another message.

Some cards use other labels. A card for a terminal command shows **Allow** and
**Skip**, plus **Manage settings**, which opens your Auto Review settings. A
card paused by one of your **Ask first** rules shows **Allow** and **Not now**,
and **Edit rule** opens your Custom Rules. When the card has no rule to offer,
you see **Allow** instead of **Allow once**, and no **Always allow**. On the
phone, tap a card to see the full request and all of its buttons.

For email the Bot sends from [its own
address](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/computer-and-apps#give-your-bots-an-email-address):

* When you ask for an email in chat, it goes out once Auto Review allows it. If
  Auto Review needs you, you see an approval card first.
* Email from a routine, an incoming message, or other work you didn't start
  with that request waits as a draft until you press **Send**.
* A forward, or an email with an attachment Auto Review can't fully read,
  always waits for your OK.

Do not approve an action whose target or effect you cannot identify. Ask the Bot
to explain it in plain language or produce a draft first.

### If you don't answer

When the work started from a chat message, the card waits for an answer and
doesn't expire on a timer. When a routine, an incoming message, or other
background work raised the card, it expires after 30 minutes. If you send a new
message instead of answering, any open card in that chat closes, and changing
your Auto Review settings also closes open cards.

A closed card shows **Expired** and says the Bot didn't do the action. If the
card offered a rule, you can still press **Always allow next time**; the Bot
saves the rule and can go ahead the next time. To finish the task now, ask the
Bot to try again.

### Shared Bots and group chats

On a [shared Bot](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots), each teammate answers cards for their
own requests in their own chat with the Bot. In a Slack thread, the card has
**Allow once**, **Deny**, and **View details**, and only the person who asked
can answer. In a group chat, only the person whose message the Bot is answering
can approve; everyone else sees who the card is waiting on, and group chat cards
don't offer **Always allow**.

An approval card asks whether the Bot may take an action. A [Secure
Form](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/vault#secure-forms) collects a password, key, or other secret,
and a connect card asks you to sign in to an [app](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/computer-and-apps#connect-an-app)
so the Bot can use it.

## Configure Auto Review

Auto Review is on by default. For each action, it either lets the action run or
has the Bot ask you first, and your Custom Rules can change that choice for the
actions you care about. Built-in safety checks always apply, whatever your rules
say.

The **Auto-review** switch is in **Settings → General**, under **Bot**; on iPhone
and Android, it's in the **Bot** group of **Settings**. With Auto Review off,
the Bot runs actions without checking them first, and your Custom Rules are
hidden and not used but kept; turn it back on to use them again.

While Auto Review is on, **Custom Rules** appears under the switch on desktop;
on the phone, tap **Custom Rules** in the **Bot** group. To add a rule:

1. Under **When Grok Bot wants to:**, describe one action in plain words, like
   “reply to emails for me.”
2. Under **It should:**, choose **Allow automatically** or **Ask first**.
3. Press **Add Rule**.

On desktop, use the edit button next to a rule, make your change, and press
**Save Rule**, or press **Cancel** to keep it as it was; use the delete button to
remove it. On the phone, tap a rule to open it, then press **Save Rule** or
**Delete Rule**.

* **Ask first** rules always stop matching actions for you.
* **Allow automatically** rules let matching actions proceed only when the
  automated review does not identify another reason to stop.
* If both kinds of rule match, **Ask first** wins.

You can have up to 20 **Allow automatically** rules and up to 20 **Ask first**
rules, and each rule can be up to 1,000 characters. If you already have 20 Allow
rules, **Always allow** on a card removes your oldest Allow rule to make room
and tells you which rule it removed.

If your admin requires Auto Review, the switch stays on and shows **Required by
your admin. You can't turn this off.** Team rules appear in the same table with
**Required by your admin. You can't edit or delete this rule.** Team rules always
apply; your own rules apply only to you, on top of the team's, and can only make
behavior stricter. Your team can also share rules that apply to your Bots
instead of your own rules; built-in safety checks still apply. See
[Auto-review rules](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/teams-and-enterprises#auto-review-rules).

Write one short, narrow rule for each action, around a known action and scope:

* Ask first before sending any external email.
* Ask first before changing a production dashboard.
* Allow automatically when running `git status` in `/workspace/reports`.

Avoid broad rules such as “allow everything in the browser.” Websites and tool
behavior change over time. Auto Review is model-based and should complement,
not replace, least privilege and explicit approval boundaries.

Personal Auto-review rules are saved to your account, so they apply from every
desktop and the mobile app.

## Keep passwords and payment details out of the chat

Bots sign in and check out without seeing secret values. A Bot uses a login
saved in [Vault](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/vault) first, then a connected password manager such
as 1Password, then asks you with a Secure Form. Values from Vault and Secure
Forms are filled into the page without being shown to the model.

When a form can't do the step, such as single sign-on, a passkey, a CAPTCHA, an
approval on another device, or a bank card verification, the Bot hands you the
computer:

1. Choose **Take over** on the request in the conversation, or open the computer
   and choose **Take control**.
2. Complete the sensitive step.
3. Choose **I'm done**, then tell the Bot to continue.

Do not send a password, one-time code, or API key in ordinary chat. For an API
key or another secret, enter it in the secure secret card when the Bot asks; the
value is masked, excluded from the transcript, and not shown to the model.

A card saved in Vault fills in at checkout without a separate approval each
time. If you want to approve every payment, don't save the card: leave
**Securely save to Bot's vault** unchecked when you enter it in a Secure Form,
or remove it in **Settings → Vault**.

If you sign in with a hardware security key, such as a YubiKey, the Bot's
browser can use a key plugged into your desktop while **Use hardware security
keys** is on under **Settings → General → Security Key**. The setting is on by
default on macOS and Windows and is not yet supported on Linux; every use asks
you to approve it first.

## Control access to your local computer

The shared Grok Bot computer runs in the cloud. Access to the Mac or Windows
computer in front of you is a separate capability.

In **Settings → Computer → Your computer**, choose **Ask every time**,
**Always allow**, or **Never allow** in **Execution on this computer**. Each
listed desktop has its own setting; until a desktop is listed, the page shows
**Execution on Local Computer** instead.

The default is **Ask every time**. Use **Never allow** unless a Bot has a
specific reason to work on your local files. Your team admin can cap this
setting for the whole team; when the team's policy is stricter than yours, the
team's applies. These settings do not prevent the Bot from using its cloud
computer.

Your team's cap also applies when a Bot uses apps on your phone. See
[Let a Bot use your phone's apps](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/mobile#let-a-bot-use-your-phones-apps).

The first time a Bot asks to run a command on your computer, the conversation
shows **Allow Grok Bot and all Bots to run commands on your local computer?**
with **Always allow**, **Allow once**, **Never**, and **Deny once** (Esc).
**Always allow** and **Never** set **Execution on Local Computer** for every
Bot, and you can change the setting later in Settings. If your team's admin has
set a stricter ceiling, **Always allow** is unavailable.

## Understand the shared-computer boundary

All of your Bots share one cloud computer assigned to your user account. Files,
browser sessions, and command line credentials on that computer are available
across your Bot roster.

* Do not use separate Bots as a security boundary.
* Sign out of a service when it should no longer be available.
* Remove sensitive temporary files after the work is complete.
* Delete a connector or revoke its authorization in the source service when
  access is no longer needed.

Do not treat this user assignment as a guarantee that is broader than Cursor's
published security documentation. Review current infrastructure and encryption
controls there.

## Sharing a Bot is not a security boundary

A public share link lets others copy the Bot's configuration. It does not share
your computer or logins. Still, do not put secrets, customer data, or internal
URLs in a Bot you share. See [Share a Bot](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/bots#share-a-bot) and the
[third-party bot terms](https://x.ai/legal/bot-sharing-terms).

A [shared Bot](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots) is different: teammates chat with the same
Bot, and the apps, secrets, skills, and files its owner adds work in every
teammate's chat. Only add keys and files you're happy for everyone you share it
with to use.

## Cursor account and data settings

Grok Bot uses Cursor authentication and account data settings.

* Grok Bot requires data storage and does not support Legacy Privacy Mode.
* Privacy and data-sharing choices are managed through Cursor account settings
  and, when required, the Grok Bot access flow.
* Training opt-out follows the applicable Cursor account and privacy settings.
* Review the current [Cursor Privacy Policy](https://cursor.com/privacy) and
  [security information](https://cursor.com/security) for contractual details.

Organization administrators can restrict local-computer execution and may
provide managed setup for the cloud computer. Available controls depend on the
organization's rollout and plan.

## Remove access and working data

When a project or login should no longer be available:

1. Pause or delete related routines.
2. Sign out of websites on the shared computer.
3. Uninstall connectors and revoke their authorization in the source service.
4. Remove sensitive project files from `/workspace`.
5. Hide or delete Bots that should no longer appear in Grok Bot.
6. Use the account settings flow if you need to delete the Cursor account.

Deleting a Bot does not remove shared-computer files or browser sessions.
Backend retention and account deletion follow the applicable Cursor terms.

## Use a least-privilege setup

* Connect only the tools a workflow needs.
* Use scoped service accounts where the source system supports them.
* Start with read-only tasks and draft outputs.
* Keep sending, publishing, purchasing, deletion, and production changes behind
  approval.
* Review installed connectors and active routines regularly.
* Pause a routine when its source system or expected workflow changes.
* Preserve source links and an action log for important decisions.
