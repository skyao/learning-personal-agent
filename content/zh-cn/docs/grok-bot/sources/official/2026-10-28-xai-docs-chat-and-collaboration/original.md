# Message and collaborate

Grok Bot is designed to feel like messaging a teammate. Keep requests natural,
but make the outcome and the decision boundary explicit: what the Bot may
change, and where it must stop for you.

## Message a Bot

Open a Bot from the sidebar and type a message. You can:

* Paste text, links, and images
* Attach local files
* Dictate into the composer
* Start a voice chat
* Play a voice memo a Bot sent
* Ask for a saved [skill](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/skills-routines-and-automations) by name
* Mention a Bot, group, routine, or app with `@`
* Reply to a specific message
* React to a message
* Send another instruction while work is in progress

The transcript shows tool activity, computer use, created files, questions,
approval requests, and voice memos alongside normal messages.

### Dictate a message

Voice typing turns your speech into text in the composer. You read it, edit it,
and send it like any other message, and the Bot replies in text.

On desktop, choose **Start voice input** in the composer, or press `Cmd/Ctrl+D`
while the prompt is focused. You can also hold the keys while you talk.

On iPhone and Android, use **Start dictation** in the composer. Stop dictation
before you start a voice chat. See [Grok Bot for Mobile](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/mobile).

### Play a voice memo

A Bot can reply with a voice memo in the conversation. Choose **Play voice
memo** to listen, **Pause voice memo** to stop, and expand the memo to read
the transcript.

### Start a voice chat

A voice chat is a live spoken conversation with one Bot: the Bot answers out
loud and keeps listening until you hang up. Voice chat works in the desktop app
and the phone app.

1. Open the chat with the Bot and leave the composer empty.
2. Choose **Start voice chat**, the waveform button in the composer.
3. Allow microphone access if your computer or phone asks.

The call shows **Connecting…** on desktop or **Calling…** on the phone, then the
Bot starts talking. **Start voice chat** shows only when the composer is empty;
if the composer is empty and you still don't see it, update Grok Bot. While you
are on the line, the app shows **Voice chat**, and on desktop the sidebar can
show **Voice chat in progress**.

During a call you can **Mute** or **Unmute** your microphone, **Hang up**, or
choose **Show transcript** to read along. In a call with your own Bot, **Show
settings** changes the **Voice**, the **Speed**, and the **Language**;
**Auto-detect** picks the language from what you say. You can open other chats
while the call runs; on desktop, choose **Return to the voice chat** to go back.
Only one voice chat runs at a time, so starting another asks **End the current
voice chat?**; choose **End and Chat** to switch.

Voice chat works with one Bot at a time, not in group chats; open that Bot's
own chat to start a call. On desktop you can also voice chat with a teammate's
[shared Bot](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots) from your own chat with it.

If the connection drops, Grok Bot tries to reconnect on its own first, so a
short drop usually picks back up without you doing anything. If it can't, the
call ends with **Voice chat failed**, and the notice may say **Connection
lost**, **No connection**, or **The call ended unexpectedly**. Choose
**Dismiss**, check your internet connection, and choose **Start voice chat**
again.

If Grok Bot says microphone access was denied, allow it to use the microphone in
your system settings. If it says no microphone was found, connect one and try
again. To choose which microphone the desktop app uses, open **Settings** and
pick one under **Microphone**.

When the call ends, the conversation includes a **Voice chat** card with the
call's length; open it to read the full transcript. If the call left work to
do, the Bot may follow up in the chat with next steps or results. Grok Bot may
ask **How was the call?**; choose **Good** or **Bad** to send feedback.

### Review a draft before it is sent

When a Bot prepares an email or Slack message for you, the conversation can
show an editable draft. Review the recipients and body, then choose **Send**,
or **Send message** for a Slack draft in the desktop app. Choose **Discard** to
drop the draft.

Bots draft outgoing messages for your review by default. A draft card shows
**Needs approval**. If you'd rather have a Bot send without preparing drafts,
open that menu on one of its drafts and choose **Disable drafts for Bot**. The
Bot then sends directly, subject to your
[Auto Review](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/approvals-security-and-privacy#configure-auto-review)
settings. The choice applies to that Bot only, and only its owner sees it; it
isn't offered in group chats. Email from the Bot's [own
address](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/computer-and-apps#give-your-bots-an-email-address) that you
didn't request in chat, such as email from a routine, always waits as a draft. To get
drafts back, choose **Needs approval** on a draft card or ask the Bot. If the
change doesn't save, the card shows `Couldn't save. Try again.`; choose
**Retry**.

### Redirect work in progress

Send a new message when priorities change. A direct message from you takes
priority over background work and can redirect the current turn.

Send a direct “Stop now” message when work should end immediately. This does not
undo actions the Bot already completed.

### Chat in X Chat

You can also chat with your Bots in X Chat, in the X app on iOS and Android and
on x.com. They're the same Bots you use in the Grok Bot app. X Chat support is
rolling out gradually, so it may not show up for you yet even if your plan
includes it, and it needs the latest version of the X app.

You need a plan that includes Grok Bot. On [The X
Subscription](https://docs.x.ai/x-subscription/overview), that's **Premium**, **Super**, or
**Ultra**; **Plus** doesn't include Grok Bot. Legacy Cursor plans and linked
SuperGrok or X Premium+ accounts that include Grok Bot also work. See [Grok Bot
on The X Subscription](https://docs.x.ai/x-subscription/grok-bot).

Your Grok account also needs to be connected to a Cursor account. Connecting
from X Chat works only for personal accounts. It isn't available when your
email is on a domain your company manages, your Cursor account is on a team, or
your Cursor account is on a [legacy request-based
plan](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing#legacy-request-based-pricing).
If a Cursor account already uses your email, you need to agree before it's
connected.

| What's happening | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Your plan doesn't include Grok Bot | Choose **Premium** or higher on The X Subscription. |
| Your Cursor account, or its team, uses Privacy Mode (Legacy) | Switch your Cursor account to Privacy Mode. On a team, a team admin changes the team's privacy setting. |
| Your Cursor account is on a legacy request-based plan | Grok Bot isn't available on legacy request-based plans. |
| Your email is on a domain your company manages, or your Cursor account is on a team | Connecting from X Chat isn't available. Use Grok Bot in the Grok Bot app instead. |
| Your Grok account's email isn't verified | Verify your email on Grok, then try again. |
| More than one Cursor account uses your email | [Contact support](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/troubleshooting) with the email address. |
| You've used up your Grok Bot usage | See [How does Grok Bot usage work?](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/plans#how-does-grok-bot-usage-work) |
| Your Bots don't show up in X Chat | Update the X app to the latest version, then quit and reopen it. |
| You see a new Bot instead of your own, or tapping your Bot shows **Something went wrong** | Your X account may be connected to a different Grok account. Follow the steps below. |

X Chat uses the Grok account your X account is connected to. If you have more
than one Grok account, that may not be the one you use with Grok Bot, and
trying again doesn't help. To connect your X account to the Grok account you
use with Grok Bot:

1. In a browser, sign in at [accounts.x.ai](https://accounts.x.ai) with the Grok
   account you use with Grok Bot.
2. In the same browser, sign in to [x.com](https://x.com) with your X account.
3. Open [x.com/i/jf/grok/entry](https://x.com/i/jf/grok/entry). Choose to link
   another account, then allow access for the Grok account you signed in with.
4. Quit and reopen the X app, or reload x.com, and open your Bots again.

If that Grok account is already connected to a different X account, this
doesn't work. If none of these match, [contact
support](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/troubleshooting) with your X handle and the email on your
Grok account.

## Start a group chat

Use a group when several Bots need one shared outcome and visible handoffs.
You can also add a Bot a teammate [shared with you](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots), but
not alongside Bots that run on your own computer.

1. Choose **New chat**, press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N`, or open the command palette
   with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` and choose **New group chat**.
2. In the **To:** field, add two to six Bots.
3. Open the group, then edit its generated name if needed.
4. Describe the shared outcome and who owns the next step.

On iPhone or Android, use **+ → New Group Chat**. Group membership can be
edited later.

To rename a group on desktop, right-click it in the sidebar and choose **Rename
chat**, or click the group's name at the top of the chat and click the name in
its details to edit it. On the phone, tap the group's name at the top of the
chat, tap **Edit**, change the **Name**, and tap **Done**. To change what the
group is for, tell the Bots in the group.

Group chats don't have the per-Bot **Notifications** switch. See [Control
notifications](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/settings-and-notifications#control-notifications).

### Direct a message

* Write normally to let the participating Bots decide who should respond.
* Type `@` and select a Bot when one teammate owns the request.
* Choose **Reply** on a Bot's message to direct your answer to that Bot.
* Mention multiple Bots when the request genuinely needs each of them.
* Use `@everyone` sparingly for a group-wide update.

Bots can post into the group and pass work among themselves. A useful kickoff
assigns one owner per stage:

> @Researcher gather the source material and link every claim. @Writer turn the
> findings into a launch draft. @Reviewer check the draft against the sources
> and list only blocking issues. Do not publish anything.

Your messages in a group can include attachments. A Bot's replies there can
include files, questions, and forms, as in a one-to-one conversation, and your
answer to a question or form goes back to the Bot that asked. Approval
requests, secret and login requests, and email or Slack drafts do not appear in
a group. Bot-to-group handoff messages are text-only, so a Bot should send an
image directly to another Bot when that teammate must inspect it.

### Keep replies in the group

When you write in a group chat, the Bots answer there. A Bot can also message
you in its own chat, or message another Bot to hand off work; those messages
show up in the Bots' own chats, not in the group.

To keep a Bot's replies in the group, tell it there: “Reply here in the group.
Don't message me privately about this.” To make it a lasting rule, ask each Bot
to remember it: “Remember: in group chats, reply in the group.”

### Stop Bots from messaging each other

There is no switch for this. Bots message each other to hand off work, and they
follow your instructions about it.

1. Tell the Bots in the chat, for example: “Don't message other Bots. Ask me
   first.”
2. To keep the rule, ask each Bot to remember it.
3. If a Bot keeps starting new work, open that Bot's chat and ask it to stop.

To quiet a helper Bot without deleting it, turn off its notifications or hide
it. Every Bot reply counts toward your usage, including replies in a group and
messages between Bots, so fewer Bots in a group means fewer replies.

## Let Bots hand work off

A Bot can send an asynchronous message to another Bot. The receiving Bot wakes,
handles the request, and can reply later. You can see the handoff in the
conversation.

This is useful when:

* One Bot owns a source system and another owns the deliverable
* A specialist should review a draft
* A blocker belongs to another role
* A long-running job should continue without you coordinating every step

Ask for a single owner at each stage. Parallel handoffs create duplicate work
and noisy updates.

A handoff needs a Bot acting for one person on that turn. Where you talk to it,
and whether it's a personal Bot or a [shared Bot](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots),
decide this:

| Bot | Where you ask | Can it message other Bots? | Acting for | Where the reply lands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Bot | The app, or your own Slack DM with it | Yes | You | The app chat, not Slack |
| Personal Bot | A Slack channel thread | No | Nobody, the thread is shared | The Bot says it can't do that |
| Shared Bot | A Slack channel thread or Slack DM | Yes, to that person's own Bots | The teammate who mentioned it | The same Slack thread |

To hand work between Bots from a Slack channel, share a Bot and add it to Slack.
A shared Bot has its own Slack app and handle, and anyone in the channel can
give it work. See [How do I add a shared Bot to
Slack?](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/shared-bots#how-do-i-add-a-shared-bot-to-slack)

## Use threads and reactions

Reply in a thread when feedback applies to one result or one approval request.
This keeps the main transcript focused while preserving the context of the
decision.

Use reactions for lightweight acknowledgement. Use a written reply when the Bot
needs a changed instruction; a reaction alone should not carry a safety-critical
decision.

## Find prior work

Use the search or command palette to:

* Switch between Bots and groups
* Find prior messages
* Find files, links, and routines
* Open settings and common actions
* Jump back to the matching place in a conversation

Search availability can vary during rollout. If cross-conversation results are
not available, open the relevant Bot and use its conversation history.

Press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` for the search palette, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` to search
Bots. The full desktop list is in [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts).

## Keyboard shortcuts

These shortcuts work in the Grok Bot desktop app. Use `Cmd` on macOS and
`Ctrl` on Windows and Linux unless a line says otherwise.

* Jump to / search palette: `Cmd/Ctrl+K`
* Search Bots: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F`
* New Bot: `Cmd/Ctrl+N`
* New group chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N`
* Show all keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd/Ctrl+/`
* Find in this chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+F`
* Compact sidebar: `Cmd/Ctrl+B`
* Focus prompt: `Cmd/Ctrl+I`
* Add selected text to chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+L`, which focuses the prompt when
  nothing is selected
* Sidebar Bot 1–9: `Cmd/Ctrl+1` through `Cmd/Ctrl+9`
* Previous / next Bot: `Alt+↑` / `Alt+↓`
* Back / forward in visit history: `Cmd/Ctrl+[` / `Cmd/Ctrl+]`
* Cycle Bots: `Control+Tab` / `Control+Shift+Tab` (always Control, including
  on macOS)
* Connect apps: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+W`
* Toggle Bot settings: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+,`
* Conversation details: `Cmd+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Alt+B` on macOS; `Ctrl+Alt+B` on
  Windows and Linux
* Send: `Enter` in the composer, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` from anywhere
* New line: `Shift+Enter`
* Dictate into the composer: `Cmd/Ctrl+D` while the prompt is focused
* Start voice chat: choose **Start voice chat** in the composer; there is no
  keybinding
* Open Settings: `Cmd/Ctrl+,`
* Zoom in, out, or reset: `Cmd/Ctrl+=` / `Cmd/Ctrl+-` / `Cmd/Ctrl+0`
* Fullscreen: `F11`; on macOS also `Control+Cmd+F`

To see every shortcut in the app, open the account menu and choose
**Support → Keyboard shortcuts**, or press `Cmd/Ctrl+/`.

## Keep conversations effective

* Lead with the result you need, not a detailed imitation of every click.
* Link the source of truth.
* State what the Bot may change and what requires approval.
* Ask for evidence—links, screenshots, or a short action log.
* Correct lasting preferences explicitly.
* Start a thread or a new Bot when a conversation has changed to a different
  long-lived job.
